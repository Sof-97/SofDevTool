    "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising
    permissions granted by this License.

    "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
    including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and
    configuration files.

    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation
    or translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled
    object code, generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form,
    made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is
    included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix
    below).

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,
    that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial
    revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a
    whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License,
    Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or
    merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative
    Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
    version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or
    Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for
    inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal
    Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the
    purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic,
    verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its
    representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic
    mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that
    are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing
    and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously
    marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a
    Contribution."

    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
    behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently
    incorporated within the Work.

2.  Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
    non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
    reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
    sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
    Object form.

3.  Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
    non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in
    this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
    import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to
    those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
    infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
    Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
    If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
    Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
    patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this
    License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
    filed.

4.  Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
    Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and
    in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
    copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
    the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
    any part of the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
    then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy
    of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding
    those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at
    least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as
    part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if
    provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by
    the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally
    appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only
    and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
    within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to
    the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution
    notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
    provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
    reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
    Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
    distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
    this License.

5.  Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
    Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
    Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without
    any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing
    herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement
    you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6.  Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
    trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
    required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
    Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7.  Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
    writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
    Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
    KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
    warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
    the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
    associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8.  Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
    tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
    applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to
    in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including
    any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
    character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
    to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
    commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
    the possibility of such damages.

9.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
    Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
    acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
    and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
    obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
    responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
    agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
    liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
    reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
